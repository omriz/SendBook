SendBook
========

A python api for sending a book to your kindle (or any future e-reader) without the complexity of a GUI and library
The point is to have a standalone (and cross platform) utility that will get an ebook file, convert it to whatever format and then
send it to the device via E-mail.
I want it to do everything in - including the conversion and SMTP server.
Let's say it will have a configuration file to have default format to convert to and where to send.
